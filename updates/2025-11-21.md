Key Executive Decisions
- Account federation
	- Leaning towards utilizing the Auth0 "Organization" structure to manage the multi-tenant B2B architecture: https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/organizations
	- B2B "invitations" may require that the customer organization supports 3rd party connections to their applications (for example, the customer A may have their own IDP connection for their employees, but also may need to enable an SI IDP in order to invite - would require manual intervention to allow access)
	- Considering moving RBAC management to Auth0 from console app
